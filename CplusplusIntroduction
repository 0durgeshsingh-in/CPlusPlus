C++ Introduction

C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that is widely used for software development. 
It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 at Bell Labs as an extension of the C programming language, with the addition of object-oriented programming (OOP) features, such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. 
C++ is designed to offer both high performance and flexibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from systems software to game development, real-time systems, and embedded systems.

Key features of C++ include:

1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
   Supports key OOP concepts such as classes and objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
2. Low-level memory manipulation:
   Provides features like pointers and direct memory access, which allow for fine-grained control over memory and hardware resources.
3. Performance
   C++ is known for its high performance, which makes it suitable for applications where speed and efficient resource use are critical.
4. Multi-paradigm
   C++ supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural programming, object-oriented programming, and generic programming (with templates).
5. Portability
   C++ programs can run on a variety of hardware platforms and operating systems with minimal modification, provided a suitable compiler is available.

C++ is commonly used in:

Game development: For high-performance games and graphics engines.
System software: Like operating systems and device drivers.
Embedded systems: Used in hardware interfaces and microcontrollers.
Applications requiring performance: Such as simulations, financial systems, and real-time systems.
