# C++ Operators
 ## Operators
 - An operator is a symbol that  perform specific operations on operands (values or variables).
 - It represents an action that can be performed on one, two, or more operands.

1. **Operand:** The values or variables on which operations are performed.
2. **Operator:** The symbol that specifies the operation to be performed.

## Types of Operators
   1. **Unary Operators**
      - Operate on a single operand.
      - Examples
         * Arithmetic: +, - (unary plus/minus)
         * Increment/Decrement: ++, --
         * Logical NOT: !
         * Address-of: &
         * Dereference: *
           
   3. **Binary Operators**
      - Operate on two operands.
      - Examples
         * Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %
         * Relational: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
         * Logical: &&, ||
         * Bitwise: &, |, ^, <<, >>
         * Assignment: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
           
   5. **Ternary Operator**
 
1. Arithmetic Operators

8. Type-Casting Operators
9. Pointer Operators
10. Comma Operator
11. Sizeof Operator
