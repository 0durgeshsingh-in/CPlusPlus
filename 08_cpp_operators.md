# C++ Operators
 ## Operators
 - An operator is a symbol that  perform specific operations on operands (values or variables).
 - It represents an action that can be performed on one, two, or more operands.

1. **Operand:** The values or variables on which operations are performed.
2. **Operator:** The symbol that specifies the operation to be performed.

## Types of Operators
   1. **Unary Operators**
      - Operate on a single operand.
      - Examples
         * Arithmetic: +, - (unary plus/minus)
         * Increment/Decrement: ++, --
         * Logical NOT: !
         * Address-of: &
         * Dereference: *
           
   2. **Binary Operators**
      - Operate on two operands.
      - Examples
         * Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %
         * Relational: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
         * Logical: &&, ||
         * Bitwise: &, |, ^, <<, >>
         * Assignment: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
           
   3. **Ternary Operator**
      - Operates on three operands.
         * **Conditional: ?** : Syntax: condition ? expr1 : expr2

 # Operator Categories
 1. Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %
 2. Relational Operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
 3. Logical Operators: &&, ||, !
 4. Bitwise Operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
 5. Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, etc.
 6. Increment/Decrement Operators: ++, --
 7. Conditional Operator: ? :
 8. Special Operators:
    - Sizeof: sizeof
    - Pointer: *, &
    - Member Access: ., ->
    - Type Cast: (type)
    - Comma: ,
