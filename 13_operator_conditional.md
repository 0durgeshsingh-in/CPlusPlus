# Conditional Operator
- The conditional operator in C++ (also called the ternary operator) is a shorthand for an if-else statement.
- It allows you to evaluate a condition and choose between two expressions based on whether the condition is true or false.

```cpp
condition ? expression1 : expression2;
```
