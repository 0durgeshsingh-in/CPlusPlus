# Flow of Control

Flow of control in C++ refers to the order in which statements are executed in a program. Normally, a program runs sequentially, executing one statement after another. However, in real-world applications, programs often need to make decisions, repeat tasks, or jump to specific parts of the code. To achieve this, C++ provides control structures that alter the normal flow of execution.

Understanding control flow is essential for writing efficient and logical programs. It allows programmers to handle different conditions, perform repetitive tasks, and control how a program reacts to user input or calculations.
