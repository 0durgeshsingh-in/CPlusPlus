# Expression
- An expression is a combination of operands (such as variables, constants, or literals) and operators (such as +, -, *, /, etc.) that is evaluated to produce a single value.

### Types of Expression

##### 1. Constant Expression
         - An expression consisting entirely of constants and evaluates at compile time.
```cpp
const int result = 10 + 20; // Compile-time evaluation
```
