# C++ Programming
* C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that is widely used for software development. 
* It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 at Bell Labs as an extension of the C programming language, with the addition of object-oriented programming 
  (OOP) features, such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. 
* C++ is designed to offer both high performance and flexibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from systems software to game 
  development, real-time systems, and embedded systems.
