# Data Types Modifier
 Data type modifiers are keywords in programming languages that are used to alter the properties of standard data types, such as their size, range, or behavior. By using modifiers, programmers can optimize the memory usage and performance of their applications. 
 
 - In C and C++, data type modifiers are often used with integer and floating-point data types. The modifiers include:
   1. **Signed:**
      - Allows the variable to store both positive and negative values.
      - Example: signed int a = -10;
   2. **Unsigned:**
      - Restricts the variable to store only non-negative (positive and zero) values, effectively doubling the range of positive numbers.
      - Example: unsigned int b = 10;
   3. **Short:**
      - Reduces the size of the variable to save memory.
      - Example: short int c = 100;
   4. **Unsigned:**
      - Extends the size of the variable to allow storing larger numbers.
      - Example: long int d = 100000;
