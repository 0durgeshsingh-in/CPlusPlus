# Data Types
* A Data Type is a classification that tells a computer what kind of data a variable can store.
  ### C++ Data are of two Types
  1. Fundamental Types
  2. Derived Types
 
  ## Fundamental Data Type
  1. **char:** Represents a single character (e.g., 'A', 'b', '1').
  2. **int:** Represents whole numbers (e.g., 10, -5, 100).
  3. **float:** Represents numbers with decimal points (e.g., 3.14, -0.5).
  4. **double:** Similar to float, but with more precision for larger decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14159, 2.71828).
  5. **void:** Represents the absence of data or no value (used in functions that don't return a value).
  6. **bool:** Represents a boolean value, either true or false.
