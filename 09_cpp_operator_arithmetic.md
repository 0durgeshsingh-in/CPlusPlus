# Arithmetic Operators
- **Arithmetic operators** in C++ are symbols used to perform basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, 
  multiplication, division, and more. 
- These operators work on numerical data types, such as int, float, double, etc.

### Types of Arithmetic Operators
1. Addition (+)
   - Adds two operands.
   - Example: a + b

2. Subtraction (-)
   - Subtracts the second operand from the first.
   - Example: a - b

3. Multiplication (*)
   - Multiplies two operands.
   - Example: a * b

4. Division (/)
   - Divides the numerator by the denominator. Returns the quotient.
   - Example: a / b
       * Note: Division by zero causes a runtime error.

5. Modulus (%)
   - Returns the remainder of a division operation.
   - Example: a % b
       * Note: Applicable only to integer types.

6. Increment (++)
   - Increases an operand’s value by 1.
   - Example:
       - Pre-increment: ++a
       - Post-increment: a++
7. Decrement (--)
   - Decreases an operand’s value by 1.
   - Example:
        - Pre-decrement: --a
        - Post-decrement: a--
